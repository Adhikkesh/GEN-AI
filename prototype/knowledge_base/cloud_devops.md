A Cloud/DevOps Engineer focuses on managing cloud infrastructure and automating the software deployment pipeline. Cloud engineers design systems hosted on platforms such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. Their main tasks include provisioning resources, scaling applications, and ensuring system reliability. On the DevOps side, they bridge the gap between development and operations by automating builds, testing, deployment, and monitoring. They use tools like Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, and Terraform to streamline workflows. A major responsibility is introducing CI/CD pipelines that reduce deployment errors and speed up product releases. Security and compliance safeguards are built into every layer of infrastructure, requiring strong knowledge of modern cyber practices. Cloud and DevOps engineers are in constant collaboration with software developers and IT departments to ensure systems run smoothly. Their goal is to minimize downtime while optimizing resources and costs. The demand is high, as organizations shift from traditional servers to flexible cloud infrastructure. This career suits detail-oriented professionals who thrive in dynamic, process-driven environments.
