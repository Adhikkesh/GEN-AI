A Product Manager is often described as the "CEO of the product," responsible for the strategy, design, and execution of a productâ€™s development. They act as the bridge between engineering, marketing, operations, and executive teams. Their role begins with understanding customer needs and defining a product vision aligned with business goals. They prioritize features in product roadmaps and decide what should be built next. Strong leadership and communication skills are essential, as they ensure alignment across multiple stakeholders. They write detailed product requirements that translate user needs into technical specifications. A large part of the role involves analyzing metrics to track performance and iterating features accordingly. Product managers balance innovation with practicality, making trade-offs between time, budget, and scope. They also need sharp market awareness to stay ahead of competitors. Unlike purely technical roles, this position requires a mix of business acumen and technological understanding. Their end goal is to deliver products that delight customers while driving business growth.
